SNAP PROJECT - 27/09/17

Downloaded SNAP from: http://step.esa.int/main/download/ (all toolboxes, version 5.00)
Downloaded Sussex Data from: scihub.copernicus.eu

To install snappy (runs in python 2.7) in conda I installed terradue jpy (without jpy install failed, conda recommended installing both - probably a dependency) -- to swap python in conda "source activate py27"
Configured snappy to run using this page "https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/50855941/Configure+Python+to+use+the+SNAP-Python+snappy+interface"

Arcgis installed via Anaconda (running in python 3.6.2)

Looked at Arcgis based notebook: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/chennai-floods-analysis/
