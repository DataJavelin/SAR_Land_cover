SNAP PROJECT - 27/09/17

Downloaded SNAP from: http://step.esa.int/main/download/ (all toolboxes, version 5.00)
Downloaded Sussex Data from: scihub.copernicus.eu

To install snappy (runs in python 2.7) in conda I installed terradue jpy (without jpy install failed, conda recommended installing both - probably a dependency) -- to swap python in conda "source activate py27"
Configured snappy to run using this page "https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/50855941/Configure+Python+to+use+the+SNAP-Python+snappy+interface"

Arcgis installed via Anaconda (running in python 3.6.2)

Looked at Arcgis based notebook: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/chennai-floods-analysis/

Played around with processing tools. Done geometric correction. Speckle filtering. Radiometric calibration (although it seems to be done in zip?).
Played around with colours. Made nice looking images, but not clear that they are nice resolution?
